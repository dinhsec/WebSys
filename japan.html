            <p>Málaga is a large city in the southern Spanish region of Andalucia and capital of the Málaga Province. The largest city on the Costa del Sol, Malaga has a typical Mediterranean climate and is also known as the birthplace of famous Spanish artist Pablo Picasso. The city offers beaches, hiking, architectural sites, art museums, excellent shopping and cuisine. While more laid back than Madrid or Barcelona, Malaga is still the center and transport hub for the hugely popular Costa del Sol region, which is flooded with tourists in the summer, and the city has certainly cashed in on the sun and sand, with lots of new construction as well as hotels and facilities geared to tourists. However, Malaga also offers some genuinely interesting historical and cultural attractions in its old city and its setting on the coast is still beautiful.</p>

            <p>Rome (or Roma in Italian) is the capital of Italy and has a population of 2.8 million, the Romans. According to legend, Rome city was founded by the twins Romulus and Remus in 753 BCE. The city is located on the banks of the river Tiber and was founded on top of seven hills; Palatine Hill, Aventine Hill, Capitoline Hill, Caelian Hill, Esquiline Hill, Quirinal Hill and Viminal Hill. Particularly the area around Palatine Hill and Capitoline Hill would later become the centre of power of the enormous Roman Empire. You can find many ruins and excavations here of the Forum Romanum and the Colosseum gives you an impression of how gladiators had to do battle in this enormous Roman amphitheatre. The Pantheon, which is now a church, has its characteristic round, open roof and is one of the best kept buildings from Roman times. And the Via Appia takes you back in time along one of the oldest roads of Rome Italy. Basically, the city of Rome is one giant museum. It is therefore no surprise that the complete historic city centre is on the UNESCO World Heritage List.</p>
